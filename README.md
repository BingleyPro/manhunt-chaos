# Manhunt Chaos

> **Manhunt Chaos** is a unqiue and exciting datapack that allows anyone to create, play and share custom presets for almost any kind of manhunt experience avaliable without writing a single command.

**Manhunt Chaos** is currently in early alpha development. At this stage, many features are still under construction. Notably, there is no preset creator available yet. The datapack includes only one preset that allows for a standard manhunt experience.

We appreciate your understanding as we continue to improve and expand the features of Manhunt Chaos. Stay tuned for future updates.
